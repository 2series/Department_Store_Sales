Data Tidying Project

The data I'll be using for this part of the project were downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/seattle-pet-licenses/data), and include information about [pet licenses issued by the Seattle Animal Shelter between 2005 and early 2017.] I'll be exploring these data and generating a few exploratory plots in the first part of the project.
